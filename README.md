# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-Custom-Dataset
Handwritten digit recognition utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a custom dataset comprising 400 training images and 100 test images demonstrates the power of deep learning in pattern recognition tasks. CNNs excel in extracting hierarchical features from images, making them well-suited for tasks like digit recognition. Through a process of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, the network learns to discern intricate patterns and nuances within the handwritten digits. The training phase involves iteratively adjusting the network's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual digit labels. Once trained, the network is evaluated on a separate test set to gauge its generalization performance. With sufficient data and careful tuning, CNNs can achieve impressive accuracy rates in handwritten digit recognition, showcasing their efficacy in real-world applications.
